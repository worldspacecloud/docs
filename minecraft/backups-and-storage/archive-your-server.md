# Archive Your Server Without Losing Progress

An archive is a complete offline copy that you control. Stopping a server does not normally stop billing, and cancelling a service may lead to permanent deletion after the provider's retention period. Download and verify your data before making account changes.

## Decide what to preserve

For a full return later, keep:

- All world and dimension folders
- `server.properties`
- Plugins or mods and their configuration
- Permissions, economy, claims, quests, and player databases
- Proxy configuration and forwarding secrets, stored securely
- Database exports when plugins use an external database
- The server software/modpack version information
- A copy of important logs and crash reports

## Create a consistent final save

1. Announce the archive date to players.
2. Ask everyone to disconnect.
3. Run:

```text
save-all flush
```

4. Stop the server normally.
5. Do not start it again while creating the archive.

## Create a panel backup

1. Open **Backups**.
2. Create a backup named with the date and server version, for example:

```text
final-archive-2026-06-21-paper-1.xx
```

3. Wait until it is complete.
4. Download the backup to your computer.

A panel backup stored only with the service is not enough if you plan to cancel the service.

## Download files independently

Use SFTP to download the full server directory as a second copy. This helps when a panel backup format is unavailable after cancellation.

If plugins use a database, export it separately using the supported database tool or plugin procedure. Copying only the plugin folder may not include externally stored data.

## Verify the archive

Before cancelling or deleting anything:

1. Confirm the archive opens without errors.
2. Check that it contains the expected world folders and `level.dat`.
3. Record the archive size and, ideally, a SHA-256 checksum.
4. Extract a copy and start it on a temporary test server.
5. Join and check builds, inventories, dimensions, plugins/mods, and permissions.

## Store more than one copy

Use the 3-2-1 principle where practical:

- 3 copies of important data
- 2 different storage types
- 1 copy in another physical or cloud location

For example: one copy on your computer, one on an external drive, and one encrypted cloud copy.

## Create a restoration note

Add a text file to the archive containing:

```text
Minecraft version:
Server software and build:
Java version:
Main JAR filename:
World level-name:
Modpack/plugin versions:
Database details required:
Original server address:
Archive date:
```

Do not write active passwords directly into an unencrypted note. Record where securely stored credentials can be found.

## Restoring later

1. Create a server with enough disk and memory.
2. Select the recorded Java and Minecraft versions.
3. Stop the empty server.
4. Upload and extract the archived files.
5. Restore databases and update database credentials if they changed.
6. Set the startup JAR and `level-name`.
7. Start and review the console.
8. Update software only after the archived version runs correctly.

## Before cancelling service

Review the current cancellation and data-retention terms in your WorldSpace account or ask support. Do not assume files will remain available after the service ends.
