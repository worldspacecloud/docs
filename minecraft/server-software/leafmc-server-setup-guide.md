# Leaf Server Setup Guide

Leaf is a performance-oriented Paper fork. It aims to retain broad Paper plugin compatibility while adding its own optimizations and configuration. Because it changes server internals, test your actual plugins and world rather than relying on generic benchmark claims.

## Before switching

1. Confirm Leaf publishes a build for your Minecraft version.
2. Check the project's current Java requirement.
3. Review release notes and known issues.
4. Update essential Paper plugins to supported versions.
5. Create and download a full server backup.
6. Record the current JAR filename and Java setting.

Do not change Minecraft version and server software in the same maintenance step unless necessary. Isolating changes makes rollback easier.

## Install Leaf

1. Download the required build from Leaf's official website or repository.
2. Stop the WorldSpace server.
3. Upload the JAR to `/`.
4. Name it `leaf.jar` or another simple filename.
5. Open **Startup** and set the server JAR variable to that exact filename.
6. Select the Java runtime required by the chosen Leaf/Minecraft version.
7. Start the server and watch **Console**.

Leaf should read normal Paper-compatible world and plugin folders, but software-specific configuration files may be generated on first start.

## First-start checks

After startup:

- Confirm the console identifies the expected Leaf and Minecraft versions.
- Check for plugin compatibility warnings.
- Join and test permissions, inventories, portals, redstone, farms, and scheduled tasks.
- Review tick performance under normal player load.
- Keep the pre-migration backup.

## Configuration approach

Do not enable every optimization at once. Change one group of settings, measure, and document the result.

Prioritize:

1. Correct view and simulation distances.
2. Reasonable entity and activation settings.
3. Pregeneration for planned world areas.
4. Removing inefficient or duplicate plugins.
5. Profiling actual lag before applying experimental options.

An optimization that reduces tick time may also change gameplay behavior. Read each setting's documentation before enabling it.

## Plugin compatibility

Most Paper plugins may work, but “Paper-compatible” is not a guarantee for every plugin that uses internal server code. Pay special attention to:

- Packet/protocol plugins
- World generators
- Anti-cheat systems
- Plugins using server internals
- Region threading or async-dependent features
- Plugins tied to an exact Paper build

Test these first and keep their logs.

## Update Leaf

1. Read the new release notes.
2. Back up the server.
3. Stop it.
4. Upload the new JAR under a versioned filename.
5. Update the startup JAR variable.
6. Start and test.
7. Remove old JARs only after the new build is stable.

## Roll back to Paper

1. Stop the server at the first sign of data or compatibility problems.
2. Restore the pre-switch backup when world/config data may have changed.
3. Point **Startup** back to the previous Paper JAR.
4. Restore the previous Java setting.
5. Start and verify.

If you only replace the JAR without restoring the backup, newly generated software configuration or world changes remain. Use the full backup for a clean rollback.
