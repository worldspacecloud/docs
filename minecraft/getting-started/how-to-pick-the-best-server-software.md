# How to Pick the Best Server Software

The best server software depends on what players must install, which custom features you need, and how closely the server should follow Vanilla mechanics. Choose the category first, then select a maintained project within that category.

## Quick decision table

| Goal | Recommended starting point | Player installation required? |
|---|---|---:|
| Pure Vanilla gameplay and testing | Vanilla | No |
| Plugins, performance controls, public survival | Paper | No |
| More gameplay configuration on top of Paper | Purpur or another maintained Paper fork | No |
| Lightweight mods and broad version support | Fabric | Usually yes |
| Large content mods and modpacks | NeoForge or Forge, as required by the pack | Yes |
| Connect multiple servers behind one address | Velocity | No, unless backend mods require it |
| Legacy network compatibility | BungeeCord | No |

## Vanilla

Choose Vanilla when exact Mojang server behavior matters more than plugins or advanced performance configuration. It is a good baseline for snapshots, technical testing, small private worlds, and datapack-only servers.

**Advantages:** direct release support and the fewest third-party changes.  
**Trade-offs:** no Bukkit-style plugins and fewer administration or performance tools.

## Paper and Paper-compatible forks

Paper is a common choice for public Java servers. It supports Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins and provides performance and configuration controls beyond Vanilla.

A Paper fork may add more tuning or gameplay options. Before choosing one, check:

- How quickly it tracks current Paper releases.
- Whether its patches change Vanilla mechanics.
- Whether the project publishes documentation and security updates.
- Whether your important plugins officially support it.
- Whether you can migrate back without special conversion.

Start with Paper when unsure. Add complexity only when you can name the feature you need.

## Fabric

Fabric is a lightweight mod loader. It is often used for optimization mods, technical servers, and custom mod collections. Some Fabric mods are server-side only, while others must be installed by every player.

Use Fabric when the mod list explicitly requires Fabric Loader. Do not place Bukkit plugins in the `mods` folder.

## NeoForge and Forge

These loaders are used by many content-heavy mods and established modpacks. The pack's manifest determines which loader and exact version you must use. NeoForge and Forge are not interchangeable for every mod.

For modpacks, use the official server pack whenever possible. Client packs can contain files that do not belong on a dedicated server.

## Hybrid software

Hybrid servers attempt to run Bukkit-style plugins and loader mods together. They can be useful in niche cases but add another compatibility layer. Problems may appear as missing events, duplicated data, broken dimensions, or crashes that neither plugin nor mod developers reproduce on supported software.

Use a hybrid only when:

- The exact mod-and-plugin combination has been tested.
- You maintain frequent off-site backups.
- You accept that upstream projects may not provide support.
- A plugin replacement as a mod, or a mod replacement as a plugin, is not practical.

## Proxies are not game servers

Velocity and BungeeCord accept player connections and route them to backend servers. They do not host a playable world by themselves. A network normally needs:

1. One proxy server.
2. One or more backend Minecraft servers.
3. Correct player-information forwarding.
4. Network restrictions that prevent direct backend access.

Velocity is the modern default for many new networks. BungeeCord remains useful when a specific legacy plugin or network design requires it.

## Questions to answer before changing

- Must players install a modpack?
- Do you need plugins, mods, or only datapacks?
- Which Minecraft version must be supported?
- Does your world contain blocks or dimensions from mods?
- Which three plugins or mods are essential?
- Is the project actively maintained?
- Can you test the migration on a copy first?

## Recommended approach

For a typical public survival server with no client download, begin with Paper. For a modpack, use the loader and exact version specified by that pack. For a multi-server network, place a Velocity proxy in front of compatible backend servers.

Always create a complete backup before changing software. A server that starts successfully is not enough—test inventories, dimensions, permissions, portals, and scheduled tasks before considering the migration complete.
