# Deleting Unused Chunks on Your World

Minecraft worlds grow as players explore. Deleting truly unused chunks can reduce storage and allow those areas to regenerate with newer terrain, but a wrong selection can permanently remove builds. Work only on a downloaded copy and keep the original backup.

## What this process does

MCA Selector edits Java Edition region files on your computer. You choose chunks to delete, save the edited world, then upload it back to the server. Deleted chunks are generated again when a player revisits them.

> **High-risk operation:** Filters cannot perfectly distinguish every important area. Manually inspect the selection before deletion.

## Create two backups

1. Ask players to disconnect.
2. Run `save-all flush`.
3. Stop the server.
4. Create a full panel backup.
5. Download the complete world to your computer.
6. Duplicate the downloaded folder and work on the copy only.

Include all dimensions and software-specific world folders.

## Open the world in MCA Selector

1. Download MCA Selector from its official project release page.
2. Open the copied world folder.
3. Select the correct dimension.
4. Wait for the map to render.

For older Bukkit-style layouts, the Nether and End may be in separate folders such as `world_nether` and `world_the_end`. Newer software may use a different unified dimension layout. Process every dimension you intend to trim.

## Select chunks carefully

Common review signals include:

- Very low inhabited time
- Chunks visited briefly during exploration
- Long, thin travel trails far from bases
- Areas outside a known world border

Do not automatically delete every low-inhabited-time chunk. New builds, farms, redstone areas, and pregenerated terrain may have low values.

A safer workflow is:

1. Use filters to produce a candidate selection.
2. Zoom in and deselect spawn, bases, roads, farms, portals, and planned areas.
3. Export or screenshot the selection for review.
4. Delete only after a second check.

## Delete and save

Use MCA Selector's delete-selected-chunks action on the copied world. Wait for it to finish and close the program cleanly.

Open the edited copy in a local server or test instance. Check:

- Spawn and major bases
- Nether hubs and portals
- End islands and gateways
- Player inventories and ender chests
- World borders
- Newly regenerated edge areas

## Upload the trimmed world

1. Keep the production server stopped.
2. Rename the current server world as an emergency copy or rely on the verified panel backup.
3. Upload the edited world using SFTP.
4. Confirm the folder name matches `level-name`.
5. Start the server and watch the console.
6. Test important locations before allowing all players back.

## Reduce future growth

- Set a reasonable world border.
- Pregenerate only the area players are expected to use.
- Avoid unlimited map-render exploration.
- Review old temporary worlds and backups.
- Monitor disk usage after events that encourage long-distance travel.

## Roll back

If any important area is missing, stop immediately and restore the original backup. Continued play can create new data that makes a partial manual repair more difficult.
