# How to Set a Server Description

The message of the day, commonly called the MOTD, appears below the server name in the Java Edition multiplayer list.

## Change the MOTD

1. Stop the server.
2. Open **Files → server.properties**.
3. Find the `motd` line.
4. Replace its value with your text:

```properties
motd=Welcome to the WorldSpace community!
```

5. Save the file.
6. Start the server and refresh the multiplayer list.

## Two-line descriptions

Many server versions accept `\n` as a line break:

```properties
motd=Survival • Events • Community\nJoin today and start your adventure!
```

Keep the message short enough to display on common screen sizes.

## Formatting

Formatting support varies by server software and version. Some servers accept legacy formatting codes, while others provide a configuration file or plugin for richer gradients and RGB colors.

When using formatting:

- Test on the oldest client version your server supports.
- Keep a plain-text copy for troubleshooting.
- Do not paste unescaped backslashes or line breaks into `server.properties`.
- Use a maintained MOTD plugin when you need player counts, rotating messages, or per-host descriptions.

## Common problems

### The change does not appear

Restart the server completely. Reloading plugins does not necessarily reload `server.properties`. Then refresh or re-add the server entry in the client.

### Special characters are corrupted

Edit the file as UTF-8 and avoid smart quotes copied from rich-text editors. If a symbol causes problems, replace it with a simple character.

### The description is cut off

Shorten each line. Client window size, interface scale, and formatting codes affect the visible length.

### A plugin overwrites the MOTD

Check proxy and server-list plugins. Their configuration may take priority over `server.properties`.
