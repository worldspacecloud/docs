# How to Add Mods to a Minecraft Server

Mods require a mod loader such as Fabric, NeoForge, or Forge. A Vanilla, Paper, or Spigot server cannot load normal loader mods from the `mods` folder.

## Before you begin

Identify all four values:

1. Minecraft version
2. Loader name
3. Loader version
4. Mod version

The mod's download page must list compatibility with your exact environment. Fabric, NeoForge, and Forge files are not interchangeable.

## Install the loader first

If the server is not already modded, install the loader or use a complete modpack server pack. See [How to Set Up a Minecraft Fabric Server](./setup-a-fabric-server.md) for Fabric.

Start the clean loader once and stop it after it generates the `mods` and `config` folders.

## Upload mods

1. Create a full backup.
2. Stop the server.
3. Download each mod from its official project page or a reputable mod repository.
4. Read the dependency list. Download required libraries for the same Minecraft and loader versions.
5. Upload server-compatible `.jar` files to `/mods`.
6. Start the server and watch **Console**.

## Client-side, server-side, and both

- **Server-side only:** players usually do not install it. Examples include some performance or administration mods.
- **Client-side only:** do not place it on a dedicated server. Examples include many HUD, rendering, and keybind mods.
- **Required on both:** every player must install the same compatible mod and dependencies.

The mod author determines the side. Do not guess based only on the feature name.

## Keep players synchronized

For a custom mod set, publish:

- Exact Minecraft version
- Loader and loader version
- Complete mod list with versions
- Required configuration files
- A checksum or version number for your pack

A launcher-exported profile or maintained modpack reduces mismatch errors.

## Update mods

1. Read release notes and breaking changes.
2. Back up the server and world.
3. Stop the server.
4. Update dependencies together where required.
5. Remove the old JAR before uploading the new one.
6. Update client packs.
7. Start and test on a copy before production when the update affects world content.

Never keep two versions of the same mod in `/mods`.

## Remove a mod

Content mods can store blocks, entities, items, dimensions, and data in the world. Removing them may permanently delete or replace that content.

Use the mod's documented removal procedure. For a content mod, test removal on a world copy and keep an off-site backup indefinitely.

## Common errors

### `Mod X requires Y`

A dependency is missing or the wrong version. Install the exact compatible dependency.

### `Incompatible mod set`

One or more mods target another Minecraft version, loader, or API version. Read the complete error list rather than replacing random files.

### Server crashes with a client-class error

A client-only mod was uploaded to the dedicated server. Remove it and check the author's side information.

### Players receive registry or channel mismatch

Their mod list/config differs from the server. Reinstall the published client profile.

### World fails after an update

Stop repeated restarts. Restore the pre-update backup, then update on a test copy and follow the mod's migration notes.
